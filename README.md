# Google-Sheets-notifications
Used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15336907/email-notification-if-cell-is-changed and https://blog.chapagain.com.np/google-appscript-send-multiple-emails-reading-from-spreadsheet/ to create an App Script that sends an email notification when a Google spreadsheet is edited.
Note: there may be errors or bugs on this when added to a Google Spreadsheet's App Script. Feel free to edit it if there is better ways to implement this customizable action.
